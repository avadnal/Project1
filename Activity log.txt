20.00-22.00
I skimmed through the phrase extraction algorithm and found that for doing that,
we need word alignment as the input. I read also about IBM model 1 and 2 to find 
out whether the translation table could be used as the word alignment.

12.00-14.00
I read again about phrase extraction algorithm. I discussed with Andrew and 
Steven Bird about this matter and found that the word alignment is not come
from the IBM model 1 or 2. After that, i tried to simulate the example of 
the word alignment in the book into a list. In the beginning of my understanding
i use the position from 1

16.00-19.00
I started to code the phrase extraction in python but found a problem in 
understanding the consistency part and also the 'do until' loop in the extract
function. In this coding part, i change my code using the position index start
from 0.

21.00-21.30
I browse on the internet and take a look in the errata but it is still 
difficult to understand. 

21.30-23.00
Looking back at the concept and mathematical model for checking the consistency
and i understand that we need to check every position in the world alignment
to the range of phrase that are generated.
I tried to code that one and make into 4 conditional statements (better than the 
pseudo code that in the book). The 4 conditional statements basically just checking:
1. If the position e and f in the word alignment inside the phrase range
2. If the position e and f in the word alignment outside the phrase range
3. If the position e outside the phrase range, meanwhile the f inside the phrase range
4. If the position e inside the phrase range, meanwhile the f outside the phrase range


23.00-24.00
I add also some checking in the 'do until' loop in the extract function. My consideration
is the 'fe' should not be outside the len of f sentence. If i don't put this condition 
probably in some cases the code will give an infinite output because it would add 1
to the 'fe' meanwhile 'fe' is not found in the word alignment (already outside the range).
The same thing also happened with the 'fs' which i put another extra condition that the fs
could not be lower than 0.

13.00-14.00
I install the github and try to read the tutorial on how to upload the stuff and also 
synchronize my PC/laptop with my account

14.00-16.00
I check my code and remove all of the debugging stuff like "print"

21.30-23.30
I made another function "print_phrase_pair" just to make the output from the code is 
easy for the user to read. Before i made the function the outcome is like this
"[(0,1) (0,3)]" which is stating the range word position in english and in foreign 
language

10.30-12.15
I add some documentation to the code and upload into the github
